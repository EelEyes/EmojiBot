Look this thing is a mess and I don't know how to use git.
But for now this is the raw code I used to do the basic functions for the EmojiBot.
It also assumes the existence of keys.py and emoji_list.json not included in the repo for reasons enumerated below.
keys.py includes the bot's unique token which cannot be publically accessible on the internet as well as my discord ID which is how I issue it Dev only commands.
emoji_list.json needs to be kept up-to-date as new emojis are added and having a static version in this repo would only confuse things during patching.
When I get better at git I can probably make both of those more viable to include with caveats and such.
